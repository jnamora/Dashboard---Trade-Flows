Drawing inspiration from the cosmic dance of celestial bodies, where bigger bodies attract smaller ones—such as the Earth attracting the Moon, and the Sun governing the movements of planets while galaxies gravitate around their own center—the same process occurs in international trade, where larger economies exert a pull on smaller ones in the realm of global commerce.

This paper explores the gravitational dynamics of international trade through the lens of the gravity equation, shedding light on its relevance for understanding the complexities of global commerce. By leveraging the analogy of celestial bodies and gravitational forces, we aim to visually depict a more nuanced interaction between economies and the underlying principles that shape their trade relationships.
